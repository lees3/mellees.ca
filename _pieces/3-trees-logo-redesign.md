text: "This project was done as a simulated logo redesign for the business called 3 Trees. The original logo, included below, was hand drawn and inconsistent on both the store front and the website."
text-2: "Here are my initial sketches."
text-3: "This is the final piece. The logo was put into a Logo Brand Guidelines booklet to be handed back to the client, outlining all of the branding information and ways that the logo should and should not be used."
