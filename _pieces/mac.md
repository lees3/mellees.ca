text: "I was lucky enough to successfully complete my Graphic Design internship at the wonderful public affairs communications and advertising agency, Spark*advocacy. I was immediately drawn to Spark*advocacy because of their core goals of wanting to design for change, sparking 'a conversation about creative with stopping power'. I completed my six week internship with the agency, and was asked to stay on for an extended 3-month contract afterwards... before COVID truly interfered. Adrian Jean, Partner and Executive Creative Director of spark*advocacy, personally taught me a great deal while I was on the team. Adrian guided my design skills in the right direction, having a helping hand in the projects I worked on. Other team members I had the pleasure of being mentored by included Perry Tsergas (Partner, President and CEO), Patricia Lacroix (Senior Graphic Designer), and Raquel Alves (Graphic Designer). I am very grateful for the time I was able to spend with the Spark*team, especially during a time of learning how to work as a team during the beginning phase of COVID-19."
text-2: "I worked with a handful of awesome clients while at Spark*advocacy. One of these being the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). MAC requested a COVID campaign with Spark*advocacy to bring awareness towards how absolutely essential mined minerals and elements are to society, specifically the healthcare industry. The pieces I created for this campaign included showcasing the minerals and elements used every day by the healthcare field. Deliverables included an informational page created for the company about their upcoming campaign, as well as digital ads. All pieces were done in both french and english. These elements are pictured below, including a Tweet from MAC featuring my design to kick off their campaign."
