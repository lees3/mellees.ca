  This was a tourism elephant abuse awareness campaign. This campaign was meant to shock and pull at the heart strings of North American tourists going to places such as Thailand and participating in supporting some of the non ethical "santucaries" that exist today. These pieces are interactive and innovative, as they have never been done before.
