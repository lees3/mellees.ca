It's all about the process for me. I grew up hungry to constantly plan my next project, brainstorming the next big creative idea for upcoming life events. I crave organized creativity cultivated into clean, bold designs made to communicate a big idea in a meaningful way. I've fallen in love with beautiful typography along my graphic design journey, and it's conveniently fallen hand-in-hand with my empathetic natureâ€”combining these passions to create cohesive, smart designs.
