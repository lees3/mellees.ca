      <p class="pad-t push-none max-length"><strong>I’m a 25 year old Graphic Designer from the Ottawa area. I searched for a suitable career as long as I can remember. From four different programs and working many jobs in between, to where I am currently—a world away from then. I was chasing careers I liked, but wasn’t naturally compatible with.</strong></p>

      <p>I’m a “creative” who hadn’t realized I was even creative.</p>

      <p>I stumbled across the word “Graphic Design” a couple of years ago. I didn’t know what it was, but I liked the sound of it. After a lot of research and debate, I decided to go for it.</p>

      <p>Years later, I couldn’t imagine my life without it. I excelled at school, soaking up all of the knowledge I could from the inspiring teachers/mentors around me.  I even tried out my entrepreneurial skills and started my own business selling handcrafted natural products called Sweet Glow Naturals.  It took off surprisingly well, and gave me the opportunity to experiment with labelling/package design, branding and sales. I started the business out of my home in the spring, and by the summer I was selling at local Ottawa farmer’s markets and on the shelves of The Pampered Mom Spa. I ran Sweet Glow until it became too busy to manage while also getting busier as a freelance designer.  Note: I still make products upon request!</p>

      <p>This past summer I was blessed with my first major freelance design project, as well as a career opportunity. I had the pleasure of rebranding the awesome Ashley's Hair Design in Manotick. The new design will soon be implemented, including an engraved wooden sign that will be seen on Manotick Main Street! I was also offered a full-time position at T-Base Communications, a company specializing in creating accessible documents for people with low vision or are blind. I redesign/simplify diagrams, maps, etc. and convert them to braille.</p>

      <p>These next few months will be spent completing coding my website, gaining incredible inspiration from travels across the world, and landing an internship for the spring.<p>
